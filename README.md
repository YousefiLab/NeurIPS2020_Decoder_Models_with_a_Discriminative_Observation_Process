This repository contains an example code (in Matlab) for the direct decoer model discuused  in  ## Decoder Models with a Discriminative Observation Process.

### AutoEncoder-Intention-of-Speak:
  contains an example code for #### Decoding communicative intent using the dynamical autoencoder problem.
  you just need to run AutoEncoder_Demo.m
  
### Direct-Decoder-Wmaze:
  contains an example code for #### 1.	Decoding movement trajectories using the direct-decoder.
  you just need to run DirectDecoderPlaceCells2D_Demo.m
